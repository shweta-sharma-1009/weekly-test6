The provided code appears to be a CSS stylesheet containing styling rules for a website's layout and visual elements. Here's a short summary of what the code does:

The code sets a basic reset for all elements by resetting margins, padding, and box-sizing to ensure consistent styling across different browsers.

The .container class is designed to take up the full width of the viewport and a substantial vertical height.

The .navbar class styles a navigation bar that is sticky at the top of the page. It has a background color, box shadow, and contains a logo, navigation links, and some icons.

The .home .img-box section styles an image gallery using flex layout. Images enlarge on hover, and there are positioning and styling rules for text and images within the gallery.

The code includes styles for multiple sections such as .sec_page, .main, .main2, .main3, .electric_scooters, .Terrain_img, and more. These sections likely represent different content or features on the website.

There are classes like .boosted_txt, .minimotors_txt, .gt_collection_txt that seem to style text content associated with specific sections.

The code includes media query breakpoints for different screen sizes. For instance, it uses a responsive approach to adjust button widths, heights, and other styles based on the screen size.

Various hover effects are applied to elements, like changing colors on hover or scaling images when hovered.

The code uses images as background for some sections, like .electric_scooters and .Terrain_img.

There are button styles throughout the code with hover effects and consistent coloring.

The footer section includes links and lists for navigation, along with some content describing the purpose of the website.
